    APIs related to integrating Remote Links data with Jira Software. These APIs are available to Atlassian Connect
    apps. To use these APIs you must have the Remote Link module in your app's descriptor. Read more about Jira Software modules [here](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/software/about-jira-modules/).

    # Module

    The Remote Link module allows third-party providers to add a generic link through a public REST API and associate it with Jira issues or services.

    Supplied remote link information will be presented in the right sidebar of the new Jira issue view under Releases.

    This module also provides actions, which allows users to perform an action on the remote link.

    Note that the module key and name are not private and should therefore not contain any sensitive or personally identifiable information.

    ## Example Module

    An example can also be found at [jira-data-provider-sample-addon](https://bitbucket.org/atlassianlabs/jira-data-provider-sample-addon/src/master/), which has an `atlassian-connect.json`.

    ```

    APIs related to integrating Incident and Post-Incident Review (PIR) data with Jira Software. These APIs are available to Atlassian Connect
    apps. To use these APIs you must have the Operations module in your app's descriptor. Read more about Jira Software modules [here](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/software/about-jira-modules/).

    # Module

    The Operations module allows third-party providers to add incident and PIR information through a public REST API.

    Supplied incident information will be presented in the Incidents page in Jira Software, and as a link to any issues created via the Incidents Page.

    This module also provides actions, one which allows Jira to provide a direct link to the operations provider where the user can create a post-incident review and two which allow Jira to search for relevant workspaces and devops components.

    Note that the module key and name are not private and therefore should not contain any sensitive or personally identifiable information.

    ## Example Module

    An example can also be found at [jira-data-provider-sample-addon](https://bitbucket.org/atlassianlabs/jira-data-provider-sample-addon/src/master/), which has an `atlassian-connect.json`.

    APIs related to integrating Dev Ops Components affected by Incident data with Jira Software. These APIs are available to Atlassian Connect
    apps. To use these APIs you must have the DevOps Component module in your app's descriptor. Read more about Jira Software modules [here](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/software/about-jira-modules/).

    # Module
    The DevOps Component module allows third-party providers to add devops components through a public REST API.

    Supplied devops components information will be used by the Connection Manager tab in Jira to allow users to associate devops components with Jira projects. All incident and PIR information related to that devops component will be presented in the Incidents page in Jira Software, and as a link to any issues created via the Incidents Page.

    This module also provides actions, two will be used by Jira to let the provider know when the devops component has been associated or disassociated with a Jira project, and two can be used by the Provider to associate a devops component with a Jira Issue.

    Note that the module key and name are not private and therefore should not contain any sensitive or personally identifiable information.

    ## Example Module

    An example can also be found at [jira-data-provider-sample-addon](https://bitbucket.org/atlassianlabs/jira-data-provider-sample-addon/src/master/), which has an `atlassian-connect.json`.

        Creates a new board. Board name, type and filter ID is required.

         *  `name` \- Must be less than 255 characters.
         *  `type` \- Valid values: scrum, kanban
         *  `filterId` \- ID of a filter that the user has permissions to view. Note, if the user does not have the 'Create shared objects' permission and tries to create a shared board, a private board will be created instead (remember that board sharing depends on the filter sharing).
         *  `location` \- The container that the board will be located in. `location` must include the `type` property (Valid values: project, user). If choosing 'project', then a project must be specified by a `projectKeyOrId` property in `location`. If choosing 'user', the current user is chosen by default. The `projectKeyOrId` property should not be provided.

        Note:

         *  If you want to create a new project with an associated board, use the [Jira platform REST API](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest). For more information, see the [Create project](#api-rest-api-3-project-post) method. The `projectTypeKey` for software boards must be 'software' and the `projectTemplateKey` must be either `com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:gh-kanban-template` or `com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:gh-scrum-template`.
         *  You can create a filter using the [Jira REST API](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest). For more information, see the [Create filter](#api-rest-api-3-filter-post) method.
         *  If you do not ORDER BY the Rank field for the filter of your board, you will not be able to reorder issues on the board.

         *  `filter` \- Reference to the filter used by the given board.
         *  `location` \- Reference to the container that the board is located in. Includes the container type (Valid values: project, user).
         *  `subQuery` (Kanban only) - JQL subquery used by the given board.
         *  `columnConfig` \- The column configuration lists the columns for the board, in the order defined in the column configuration. For each column, it shows the issue status mapping as well as the constraint type (Valid values: none, issueCount, issueCountExclSubs) for the min/max number of issues. Note, the last column with statuses mapped to it is treated as the "Done" column, which means that issues in that column will be marked as already completed.
         *  `estimation` (Scrum only) - Contains information about type of estimation used for the board. Valid values: none, issueCount, field. If the estimation type is "field", the ID and display name of the field used for estimation is also returned. Note, estimates for an issue can be updated by a PUT /rest/api/3/issue/\{issueIdOrKey\} request, however the fields must be on the screen. "timeoriginalestimate" field will never be on the screen, so in order to update it "originalEstimate" in "timetracking" field should be updated.
         *  `ranking` \- Contains information about custom field used for ranking in the given board.

        The board filter contains reference the project only if JQL query guarantees that returned issues will be returned from the project set defined in JQL.

        Feature Flags are identified by their ID, and existing Feature Flag data for the same ID will be replaced if it exists and the updateSequenceId of existing data is less than the incoming data.

        Submissions are performed asynchronously. Submitted data will eventually be available in Jira; most updates are available within a short period of time, but may take some time during peak load and/or maintenance times. The getFeatureFlagById operation can be used to confirm that data has been stored successfully (if needed).

        In the case of multiple Feature Flags being submitted in one request, each is validated individually prior to submission. Details of which Feature Flags failed submission (if any) are available in the response object.

        Only Connect apps that define the `jiraFeatureFlagInfoProvider` module can access this resource.
        This resource requires the 'WRITE' scope for Connect apps.

        Deployments are identified by the combination of `pipelineId`, `environmentId` and `deploymentSequenceNumber`, and existing deployment data for the same deployment will be replaced if it exists and the `updateSequenceNumber` of existing data is less than the incoming data.

        Submissions are processed asynchronously. Submitted data will eventually be available in Jira. Most updates are available within a short period of time, but may take some time during peak load and/or maintenance times. The `getDeploymentByKey` operation can be used to confirm that data has been stored successfully (if needed).

        In the case of multiple deployments being submitted in one request, each is validated individually prior to submission. Details of which deployments failed submission (if any) are available in the response object.

        Only Connect apps that define the `jiraDeploymentInfoProvider` module, and on-premise integrations, can access this resource.
        This resource requires the 'WRITE' scope for Connect apps.

        build will be replaced if it exists and the `updateSequenceNumber` of the existing data is less than the
        incoming data.

        Submissions are performed asynchronously. Submitted data will eventually be available in Jira; most updates are

        In the case of multiple Vulnerabilities being submitted in one request, each is validated individually prior to submission. Details of Vulnerabilities that failed submission (if any) are available in the response object.

        A maximum of 1000 vulnerabilities can be submitted in one request.

        Only Connect apps that define the `jiraSecurityInfoProvider` module can access this resource.
        This resource requires the 'WRITE' scope for Connect apps.

        Incidents and reviews are identified by their ID, and existing Incident and Review data for the same ID will be replaced if it exists and the updateSequenceNumber of existing data is less than the incoming data.

        Submissions are performed asynchronously. Submitted data will eventually be available in Jira; most updates are available within a short period of time, but may take some time during peak load and/or maintenance times. The getIncidentById or getReviewById operation can be used to confirm that data has been stored successfully (if needed).

        In the case of multiple Incidents and Reviews being submitted in one request, each is validated individually prior to submission. Details of which entities failed submission (if any) are available in the response object.

        A maximum of 1000 incidents can be submitted in one request.

        Only Connect apps that define the `jiraOperationsInfoProvider` module can access this resource.
        This resource requires the 'WRITE' scope for Connect apps.

        Update / insert DevOps Component data.

        Components are identified by their ID, and existing Component data for the same ID will be replaced if it exists and the updateSequenceNumber of existing data is less than the incoming data.

        Submissions are performed asynchronously. Submitted data will eventually be available in Jira; most updates are available within a short period of time, but may take some time during peak load and/or maintenance times. The getComponentById operation can be used to confirm that data has been stored successfully (if needed).

        In the case of multiple Components being submitted in one request, each is validated individually prior to submission. Details of which Components failed submission (if any) are available in the response object.

        A maximum of 1000 components can be submitted in one request.

        Only Connect apps that define the `jiraDevOpsComponentProvider` module can access this resource.
        This resource requires the 'WRITE' scope for Connect apps.

        Information about the rollout of a Feature Flag in an environment (or in summary).

        Only one of 'percentage', 'text', or 'rules' should be provided. They will be used in that order if multiple are present.

        This information may be presented to the user in the UI.

        percentage: 80
      properties:

        text:

        enabled: true
      properties:

          description: |
            Whether the Feature Flag is enabled in the given environment (or in summary).

            Enabled may imply a partial rollout, which can be described using the 'rollout' field.
          type: boolean
        defaultValue:
          description: |
            The value served by this Feature Flag when it is disabled. This could be the actual value or an alias, as appropriate.

            This value may be presented to the user in the UI.
          example: Disabled
          maxLength: 255

    FeatureFlagSummary:
      description: |
        Summary information for a single Feature Flag.

        Providers may elect to provide information from a specific environment, or they may choose to 'roll up' information from across multiple environments - whatever makes most sense in the Provider system.

        This is the summary information that will be presented to the user on e.g. the Jira issue screen.
      example:
        lastUpdated: 2018-01-20T23:27:25Z
        url: https://example.com/project/feature-123/summary
        status:
          rollout:
            percentage: 80
          defaultValue: Disabled
          enabled: true
      properties:
        url:
          description: |
            A URL users can use to link to a summary view of this flag, if appropriate.

            This could be any location that makes sense in the Provider system (e.g. if the summary information comes from a specific environment, it might make sense to link the user to the flag in that environment).
          example: https://example.com/project/feature-123/summary
          format: uri
          maxLength: 2000
          type: string
        status:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/FeatureFlagStatus'
        lastUpdated:
          description: |
            The last-updated timestamp to present to the user as a summary of the state of the Feature Flag.

            Providers may choose to supply the last-updated timestamp from a specific environment, or the 'most recent' last-updated timestamp across all environments - whatever makes sense in the Provider system.

            Expected format is an RFC3339 formatted string.
          example: 2018-01-20T23:27:25Z
          format: date-time
          type: string

    EnvironmentDetails:

        At the simplest this must be the name of the environment.

        Ideally there is also type information which may be used to group data from multiple Feature Flags and other entities for visualisation in the UI.

            This can be any monotonically increasing number. A suggested implementation is to use epoch millis from the Provider system, but other alternatives are valid (e.g. a Provider could store a counter against each Feature Flag and increment that on each update to Jira).

            Updates for a Feature Flag that are received with an updateSqeuenceId lower than what is currently stored will be ignored.

            The Jira issue keys to associate the build information with.

            You are free to associate issue keys in any way you like. However, we recommend that you use the name
            of the branch the build was executed on, and extract issue keys from that name using a simple regex. This has
            the advantage that it provides an intuitive association of builds to issue keys.

            the Provider system.

            Note that these properties will never be returned with build data. They are not intended for use as
            metadata to associate with a build. Internally they are stored as a hash so that personal information etc.

            This can be any monotonically increasing number. A suggested implementation is to use epoch millis from the Provider system, but other alternatives are valid (e.g. a Provider could store a counter against each DevOps Component and increment that on each update to Jira).

            Updates for a DevOps Component that are received with an updateSqeuenceId lower than what is currently stored will be ignored.

      Welcome to the Jira Software Cloud REST API reference. You can use this REST API to build add-ons for Jira Software,
      develop integrations between Jira Software and other applications, or script interactions with Jira Software. This page
      documents the REST resources available in Jira Software Cloud, along with expected HTTP response codes and sample
      requests.

      Jira Software is built on the Jira platform. As such, there is an overlap in functionality
      between what is provided by Jira Software and what is provided by the Jira platform. The REST API reference for the
      Jira Cloud platform is here: [Jira Cloud platform REST API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest).

      ## Authentication

      ### Authentication for Atlassian Connect add-ons

      If you are integrating with the Jira REST APIs via an Atlassian Connect add-on, API calls are authenticated via JWT
      (JSON Web Tokens). This is built into the supported Atlassian Connect libraries. At a high level, authentication works
      by the add-on exchanging a security context with the application. This context is used to create and validate JWT
      tokens, embedded in API calls. To learn more, read the [Atlassian Connect authentication documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/authentication-for-apps/).

      Some integration APIs such as [Feature Flags](#api-group-Feature-Flags) are only available to Atlassian Connect apps that
      define the relevant [module](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/about-jira-modules/) related to that API.
      Other APIs, such as the [Development Information](#api-group-Development-Information), [Builds](#api-group-Builds), and [Deployments](#api-group-Deployments) APIs
      are available to both Atlassian Connect apps and on-premises tools using Jira Software's
      [OAuth credentials](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/software/integrate-jsw-cloud-with-onpremises-tools/) for system-to-system integration.

      ### Authentication for REST API requests

      If you are integrating directly with the REST APIs, rather than via an Atlassian Connect add-on, use one of the
      authentication methods listed below:
      * [OAuth 2.0](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/software/scopes-for-oauth-2-3LO-and-forge-apps/) -
        This token-based method is the recommended method. It is more flexible and secure than other options.
       * [OAuth 1.0a](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-rest-api-oauth-authentication) -
       This is a legacy authentication method and, therefore, isn't recommended. Instead use OAuth 2.0.
       * [Basic HTTP](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-rest-api-basic-authentication/) -
       This method is only recommended for tools like scripts or bots. It is easier to implement, but much less secure.

      Note, Jira itself uses cookie-based authentication in the browser, so you can call REST from Javascript on the page and
      rely on the authentication that the browser has established. To reproduce the behavior of the Jira log-in page (for
      example, to display authentication error messages to users) can `POST` to the `/auth/1/session` [resource](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/cloud/#auth/1/session).

      ### Authentication for on-premises integrations

      If you are integrating an on-premises app with the Jira REST APIs, API calls are authenticated via an OAuth token.
      To obtain a token, create a set of OAuth credentials with permissions for the APIs that app needs to access.
      Use the credentials to request a token by calling `https://api.atlassian.com/oauth/token`.
      See [Integrating Jira Software Cloud with on-premises tools](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/software/integrate-jsw-cloud-with-onpremises-tools/) for details.
      Note that only the [Development Information](#api-group-Development-Information), [Builds](#api-group-Builds), and [Deployments](#api-group-Deployments) APIs are currently available for on-premises integrations.
      To simplify development, we have a separate [downloadable API spec](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/software/on-premise-swagger.json).

      Atlassian has developed an [open source plugin for Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/atlassian-jira-software-cloud-plugin), which you can use to bootstrap development.
      This plugin uses the authentication method described above and calls the Builds and Deployments APIs.


      #### Base URL differences

      When building an on-premises integration, the base URL for API operations is different to the base URL used for Connect apps. This is because requests from on-premises integrations (OAuth) need to be sent via the Atlassian API proxy at `https://api.atlassian.com`.

      This document does not display the base URLs used by on-premises integrations. Therefore, when using an operation, you must replace `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/{type}/{version}/{operation}`
      with `https://api.atlassian.com/jira/{type}/{version}/cloud/{cloudId}/{operation}`.

      For example:
      * Builds API: Change the path from `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/builds/0.1/bulk` to `https://api.atlassian.com/jira/builds/0.1/cloud/{cloudId}/bulk`.
      * Development Information: Change the path from `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/devinfo/0.10/bulk` to `https://api.atlassian.com/jira/devinfo/0.1/cloud/{cloudId}/bulk`. Note the version change.
      * Deployments: Change the path from `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/deployments/0.1/bulk` to `https://api.atlassian.com/jira/deployments/0.1/cloud/{cloudId}/bulk`.

      Note, get the `cloudId` for a Jira instance by calling `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/_edge/tenant_info`.


      ## URI structure

      Jira Agile's REST APIs provide access to resources (data entities) via URI paths. To use a REST API, your application
      will make an HTTP request and parse the response. The Jira Agile REST API uses [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)
      as its communication format, and the standard HTTP methods like `GET`, `PUT`, `POST` and `DELETE` (see API descriptions
      below for which methods are available for each resource). URIs for Jira Agile's REST API resource have the following
      structure:

          http://host:port/context/rest/api-name/api-version/resource-name

      Currently there are two API names available, which will be discussed further below:

       * `auth` - for authentication-related operations, and
       * `api` - for everything else.

      The current API version is `1`. However, there is also a symbolic version, called `latest`, which resolves to the
      latest version supported by the given Jira Software Cloud instance. For example, if you wanted to retrieve the JSON
      representation of a board with `boardId=123`, from a Jira Software Cloud instance at `https://jira.atlassian.net`, you
      would access:

          https://jira.atlassian.net/rest/agile/latest/board/123

      ## Pagination

      Pagination is used for the Jira REST APIs to conserve server resources and limit response size for resources that
      return potentially large collection of items. A request to a pages API will result in a values array wrapped in a JSON
      object with some paging metadata, like this:

      #### Request

          http://host:port/context/rest/api-name/api-version/resource-name?startAt=0&maxResults=10

      #### Response

      ```javascript
      {
          "startAt" : 0,
          "maxResults" : 10,
          "total": 200,
          "values": [
              { /* result 0 */ },
              { /* result 1 */ },
              { /* result 2 */ }
          ]
      }
      ```

       * `startAt` - the item used as the first item in the page of results.
       * `maxResults` - how many results to return per page.
       * `total` - the number of items that the calling user has permissions for. This number *may change* while the client requests the next pages. A client should always assume that the requested page can be empty. REST API consumers should also consider the field to be optional. This value may not be included in the response, if it is too expensive to calculate.

      Clients can use the `startAt`, `maxResults`, and `total` parameters to retrieve the desired number of results. Note,
      each API resource or method may have a different limit on the number of items returned, which means you can ask for
      more than you are given. The actual number of items returned is an implementation detail and this can be changed over
      time.

      ## Experimental methods

      Methods marked as experimental may change without an earlier notice. We are looking for your feedback for these methods.

      ## Query parameters

      All query parameters for the resources described below are optional, unless specified otherwise.

      ## Special Request and Response headers

       -   **X-Atlassian-Token** (request): Operations that accept multipart/form-data must include the `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` header in requests.
      Otherwise the request will be blocked by XSRF protection.
      -   **X-AACCOUNTID** (response): This response header contains the Atlassian account ID of the authenticated user.

      ## Jira Software field input formats

      Jira Software provides a number of custom fields, which are made available in the Jira platform REST API. The custom
      fields are: `Sprint`, `Epic link`, `Epic name`, and `Story points`.

      You can read and edit these custom fields via the [issue resource](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/cloud/#api/2/issue)
      of the Jira Platform REST API. In order to identify the custom field that you want to read or edit, you'll need the
      custom field id. To obtain the custom field id, retrieve the list of fields from the [fields resource](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest/#api/2/field-getFields)
      and search for the custom field. It's better to find the field based on the schema where possible (e.g. the Sprint
      field is identified by "`com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:gh-sprint`"), as custom field names are mutable. The custom field
      id will be in the id, (e.g. `id: customfield_10007`).

      If you only need to get the value of the custom field for a single issue, you may want to use the [issue resource](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira-software/REST/cloud/#agile/1.0/issue-getIssue)
      provided by the Jira Software REST API instead. This resource returns the issue with all Jira Software-specific fields,
      including the fields listed above. These fields will also be formatted as proper fields with keys, in the response.

      Note, Jira Software also has a number of internal custom fields, which are: `Epic Color`, `Epic Status`, `Flag`, `Rank`.
      These internal fields shouldn't be read or updated using the REST API and are not documented below.

      ##### Sprint custom field

      The Sprint custom field contains a list of sprints for a given issue. This list includes the active/future sprint that
      the issue is currently in, as well as any closed sprints that the issue was in previously.

      For legacy reasons, the [Get issue (Jira platform) method](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/cloud/#api/2/issue-getIssue)
      returns the Sprint custom field with sprints in a `toString` format, which is difficult to parse. See the example below.

      _**Deprecation notice:** The `toString` representation of sprints in the Sprint custom field that is returned by Get
      issue (Jira platform) will soon be removed. See the [notice](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/deprecation-notice-tostring-representation-of-sprints-in-get-issue-response/)._

      ###### Example - Get issue (Jira platform) response

      ```javascript
      customfield_11458": [
          "com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.sprint.Sprint@1bf75fd[id=1,rapidViewId=1,state=CLOSED,name=Sprint 1,goal=Sprint 1 goal,startDate=2016-06-06T21:30:53.537+10:00,endDate=2016-06-20T21:30:00.000+10:00,completeDate=2016-06-06T21:30:57.523+10:00,sequence=1]",
          "com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.sprint.Sprint@1689feb[id=2,rapidViewId=1,state=FUTURE,name=Sprint 2,goal=Sprint 2 goal,startDate=<null>,endDate=<null>,completeDate=<null>,sequence=2]"
      ]
      ```

      If you want to parse the sprint information, use either the [Get issue (Jira Software) method](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira-software/REST/cloud/#agile/1.0/issue-getIssue)
      or [Get issue (Jira platform) method](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/cloud/#api/2/issue-getIssue) with expanded
      `versionedRepresentations` instead, both of which return sprints in a proper format. See the example below.

      ###### Example - Get issue (Jira platform) response with expanded versionedRepresentations

      ```javascript
      "customfield_10021": {
          "1": [
              "com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.sprint.Sprint@1bf75fd[id=1,rapidViewId=1,state=CLOSED,name=Sprint 1,goal=Sprint 1 goal,startDate=2016-06-06T21:30:53.537+10:00,endDate=2016-06-20T21:30:00.000+10:00,completeDate=2016-06-06T21:30:57.523+10:00,sequence=1]",
              "com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.sprint.Sprint@1689feb[id=2,rapidViewId=1,state=FUTURE,name=Sprint 2,goal=Sprint 2 goal,startDate=<null>,endDate=<null>,completeDate=<null>,sequence=2]"
          ],
          "2": [
              {
                  "id": 1,
                  "name": "Sprint 1",
                  "state": "closed",
                  "boardId": 1
              },
              {
                  "id": 2,
                  "name": "Sprint 2",
                  "state": "future",
                  "boardId": 1
              }
          ]
      }
      ```

      If you want to update a sprint, you need to know the sprint id, which is a number. See the example below. Note, an
      issue can only be in one active or future sprint at a time, and only the active/future sprint can edited.

      ###### Example - Update issue request

      ```javascript
      "customfield_10021": 2
      ```

      ##### Epic link custom field

      The Epic link custom field contains the key of an epic that a given issue belongs to. Be aware that only the issue key
      of the existing epic can be set. Also, the Epic link cannot be set for sub-tasks and epics.

      ###### Example

      ```javascript
      "customfield_11458": "EPIC-1"
      ```

      ##### Epic Name

      The Epic name custom field contains the name of an epic that a given issue belongs to. Be aware that only the issue key
      of the existing epic can be set. Also, the epic link cannot be set for sub-tasks and epics.

      ###### Example

      ```javascript
      "customfield_11410": "Epic Name"
      ```

      ##### Estimation

      Jira Software provides a `Story Points` custom field, however the field is just a regular numeric field. The type of
      estimation and field used for estimation is determined by the board configuration. You can get this from the
      [board configuration resource](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira-software/REST/cloud/#agile/1.0/board-getConfiguration).
      Note that if the estimation field is not on a screen, it cannot be edited, and you should use the
      [Estimate issue for board method](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira-software/REST/cloud/#agile/1.0/issue-estimateIssueForBoard) instead.
